#How Much Did It Rain? II (kaggle)

##Predict hourly rainfall using data from polarimetric radars

After incorporating feedback from the Kaggle community, as well as scientific and educational partners, the Artificial Intelligence Committee of the American Meteorological Society is excited to be running a second iteration of the How Much Did It Rain? competition.

How Much Did It Rain? II is focused on solving the same core rain measurement prediction problem, but approaches it with a new and improved dataset and evaluation metric. This competition will go even further towards building a useful educational tool for universities, as well as making a meaningful contribution to continued meteorological research.
